## Instructions

Using [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/L7u0enlOxKXZuYtDRGjnXI/React-Developer-Challenge-Spec?node-id=0%3A1), and a fork of [this repo](https://codesandbox.io/s/admiring-agnesi-gybk2?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark) create a small react app which does the following:

- Render a logo, email input, password input, and submit button
- Display generic validation error messages:
  - invalid email address
  - password is fewer than 8 characters
- Match the designs as closely as possible
- Responsively render for mobile and tablet/desktop
- Use styled-components or emotion for any component styling
- Follow accessibility best-practices

### Notes

* Behaviour on very small (<360px) screens is odd in current Chrome (v78.0) - this appears to be a browser bug, but something of an edge case

* Sizes are rationalised to whole multiples or sensible fractions of REM values. As a result, the layouts are not pixel perfect to the suplied flat artwork, but are better suited to use in a coherent design system. Refer to visual diffs below.
